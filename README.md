# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients don't apply correctly in certain situations. The issue occurs when using gradients with other styling properties, like padding or rounded corners. The gradient may appear partially or not at all, leading to unexpected visual results.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the gradient background isn't rendered as expected.
